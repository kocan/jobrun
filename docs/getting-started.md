# Getting Started with JobRun

Welcome to JobRun! This guide walks you through setting up your business, adding customers, creating jobs, and sending your first invoice.

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Business

When you first open JobRun, you'll go through a quick onboarding flow:

1. **Pick your industry** — Choose from options like Plumbing, Electrical, Landscaping, Cleaning, or General Contractor. This customizes your default price book and terminology.

2. **Enter your business info** — Add your business name, phone number, and email. This appears on estimates and invoices you send to customers.

3. **Review & confirm** — Double-check everything looks right and tap **Get Started**.

> **Tip:** You can change your industry and business info anytime in **More → Settings**.

1. Go to the **Customers** tab
2. Tap the **+** button
3. Fill in their name, phone, email, and address
4. Tap **Save**

Your customer is now ready for jobs and estimates!

> **Tip:** You can also add customers on-the-fly when creating a job — just tap **+ Add New Customer** in the customer picker.

1. Open a completed job
2. Tap **Create Invoice** — this pre-fills the line items and customer info
3. Review the invoice details and total
